## ðŸš— Features

- Detects obstacles using **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**  
- Displays distance and status on a **16x2 LCD**:
  - `SAFE` â†’ distance > 20 cm  
  - `NEARBY` â†’ 10 cm < distance â‰¤ 20 cm (Yellow LED ON)  
  - `VERY CLOSE` â†’ distance â‰¤ 10 cm (Red LED + Buzzer ON)  
- Provides visual alerts with LEDs  
- Provides audible alert with buzzer  
- Real-time updates for safe and precise parking
